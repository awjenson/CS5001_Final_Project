# A requirements file in python is a file that lists all the libraries that your project depends on.
# it is common to include in a project, so someone can easily install the needed
# libraries to run your project.
# For example
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# will install all the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file

# NOTE: For my final project, I did NOT use any libraries.
