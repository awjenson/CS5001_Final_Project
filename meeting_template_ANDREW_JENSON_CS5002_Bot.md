# Meeting Template

> Student: Andrew Jenson<br>
> Class: CS 5001<br>
> Semester: Fall 2023

Go through this template in preparation for your meeting with the course staff member. We are not grading you on this template, just will help with questions and discussion. Please note, staff have the right to ask you to schedule a second meeting. The goal is to help you flesh out a reasonable project for this course, so make sure to use these meetings as a resource!

## Project Ideas
What are some ideas for your project? Why does that interest you?

><mark>My Response:</mark>
>
> * CS 5002 Chat Bot
>   - Quiz questions and get tips to succeed in CS 5002
> * Time and location-based tips app
>   - I'm interested in software that provides predictive information that is personalized to each user (e.g. tips based on day, hour, user preferernces)
> * Instagram bot (post photos)
>   - I want to automate this to create posts for my iPhone app's social media marketing
> * Python/ChatGPT-related project (film/TV related?)
>   - ChatGPT is growing and I'd like to learn how to use it
>   - I have a passion for film (I used to work in film)
> * Automating a daily task
>   - I want to save time and help others save time
> * Creating an exercise tracker
>   - I exercise daily and curious if Python can help make tracking easier
> * Web scrapper
>   - I was manually scrapping grad school data from websites when I was applying for grad school

## What are the big ideas?
How does this address some of the big learning ideas of 5001?

><mark>My Response:</mark>
>
> * CS 5002 Chat Bot:
>   - **01: Flow Chart:** A flow chart for this app
>   - **02: Booleans Expessions & Conditionals:** Select buttons/topics, quiz and tips presented via conditionals
>   - **03: Functions and Testing:** Creating functions to perform tasks, rubric states to include tests
>   - **04: While Loops:** App will continue while you don't select 'quit' menu option
>   - **05: Strings & Lists:** Strings to display text, lists to store data, strings to display quiz stats
>   - **06: For Loops:** Read files that contain the tips and quiz questions
>   - **07: Recursion:** Unsure if I'll use this
>   - **08: Error Handling:** Will handle errors if user selects an option that does not exist
>   - **09: Dictionaries and Sets:** Dictionaries will store topics (keys) and quiz questions (values)
>   - **10: Classes & Objects:**  Classes will include: Quiz, Tip, Button
>   - **11: Stacks & Queues:** May use Queues to handle quiz questions
>   - **Searching & Sorting:** May use searching for user selected topics for quiz questions and tips

## Code Design Thoughts
Are you including classes or APIs, what about dictionaries? One of the worst things you can do is go into a project assuming you are going to 'hard' code everything (this happens often with text based games, then students get stuck). You don't have to know details yet, but you should think about separation of concerns, and how to divide up your code.

><mark>My Response:</mark>
>
> * **Classes:** Yes, will create classes for Button, Quiz, Tip, Menu, QuizResults
> * **APIs:** If I have time, I plan to connect to OpenAI's API to get ChatGPT to provide quiz questions and tips
> * **Dictionaries:** Yes, I plan to use for store discrete math topics (keys) and their related quiz questions and tips (values)
