# Meeting Template

Go through this template in preparation for your meeting with the course staff member. We are not grading you on this template, just will help with questions and discussion. Please note, staff have the right to ask you to schedule a second meeting. The goal is to help you flesh out a reasonable project for this course, so make sure to use these meetings as a resource!

## What are the big ideas?
How does this address some of the big learning ideas of 5001?

>
> * Instagram bot (post photos)
>   - Creating a class (Photo)
>   - Reading data from a photo (photo data stored in a file)
>   - Plan to have lists (to store photo data), error handling, functions
>   - Plan to have functions, abstraction

## Code Design Thoughts
Are you including classes or APIs, what about dictionaries? One of the worst things you can do is go into a project assuming you are going to 'hard' code everything (this happens often with text based games, then students get stuck). You don't have to know details yet, but you should think about separation of concerns, and how to divide up your code.

> Photo class (background color, header text, subheader text, source name text, logo text)
> API? Unsure at this time.
> Dictionary? Unsure at this time (may only need lists)

## Resources Found
What are some resources you have found already or already have access to? (APIs, libraries, past assignments, etc)
