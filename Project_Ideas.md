# Final Project Ideas

Past assignment revamp? Most of the assignments in 5001 were designed with the idea that
they could be a starting point for a larger project. If you don't have an initial
idea, they are a great place to start! Also, this list below is a great place to get 
ideas for projects.  Most importantly, pick something that interests you, and that you
can be excited about.


List originally assembled by Dr. Mark Miller, with modifications added. 

* A comparison of Python to some other programming language (with code examples).
Possible aspects comparison might include a subset of the following considerations:
  * compiled versus interpreted (where on the spectrum?)
  * verbosity, clarity, syntax, expressivity
  * early binding versus late binding
  * parameter-passing mechanism: call by reference, call by name, call by value, 
  * storage management approach (stack/heap, reference count/garbage collection)
  * performance (with measurements) versus ease of use
  * richness of available libraries
  * size of user community
  * *Should include working code examples in both languages.*
* A Python program to play a game, possibly using PyGame as a framework. This could 
be for 2 humans, with the computer's job being to provide suitable input/output and
record-keeping, or a 2 player game where the computer serves as a simple "AI" player.
Games can be a good opportunity to incorporate graphics but that’s strictly optional
  * you should avoid RPG style games just due to the size of the story. 
  * Games are often the harder project, as it is easy to make the project too big!
* An authentic pilot or prototype "app" related to either your undergraduate major field, or
an area of personal or professional interest, such as music, sports, art, film,
epidemiology, economics, etc. It could also be a laptop-based prototype of an idea for a
future mobile or web app, as well.
* A re-implementation of your solution to a previous assignment, but running on a web
site, including a description of what was involved in making that happen. 
  * It is recommended you look at the Flask library or other 'simple' software to help with hosting.
* A Text-based Adventure Game
  * This one is often misdone, and people hard code the entire game. Instead a good one should use classes,dictionaries, and files to store the game state - so your game can grow and be more generalized. 
* A rule-based Python program that checks a text file of Python code, to alert students to
poor choices of variable names or other guidelines not already flagged by the IDE
* An exploration of one of the many Python libraries that make it such a popular language:
whether it be image manipulation, Jupyter Notebook, music generation, speech
synthesis, machine learning, or ... (many to choose from)
  * No matter your project, you may find yourself drawn to other libraries, which is good! 
  In this case, the project would focus on the library, its uses, and proper demonstration 
  of the features (and drawbacks) of the library. 
* A password checker - this is more than just 'is this a good password or not', maybe checking against a dictionary, or checking against a list of known passwords, etc. Also calculations of difficulty or things like captcha's are good - so both checker and *secure* login system. 
* A Tic Tac Toe expert system using either the minimax algorithm or heuristic
programming, to create an “AI” player (even with a simple textual user interface).
* A program to draw a flowchart given a textual description
* A program to generate poetry, music, or artistic patterns
* A python program illustrating the use of a publicly available ML library for visual or
speech recognition
* Graphics-oriented interactive game: perhaps a variant of pong or snake?
* A solution to any nontrivial math or physics problem using Python, using an interesting
algorithm of your own design (but informed by what you have learned so far) Example:
Bridges of Königsberg
* A desktop app to advise children on how to choose a pet or care for certain types of pets
* An LED-lighting control system for a fish tank or a light show for a band, implemented
in Python
* A Python "reminder app" that connects to Discord or Slack
  * This is often hard to test! So think carefully how to isolate components
* A Python Discord or Slack app that connects to ChatGPT to ask it questions? (or some other external app)
* A Chess Game Manager, or Chess Puzzles such as Knights Tour or Eight Queens
* A simulation for Infectious Disease spread
* An instrumented Linked List versus Array simulator to compare various sorting
algorithms
* An expansion upon an online tutorial on a subject. For example, the tutorial teaches how to do
handwriting recognition, you complete it, but further expand it by running it on a variety of handwriting sets
and maybe check number detection. 
* Many other possibilities. Just run it by us before investing too much time!


## A few notes:
Often many projects can be very large. This does not have to accomplish all the features. It is also advisable
to build a set of simple goals, and then "stretch" goals as the project expands. 

For example, you could implement a chess game that only has pawns, knights, and a king, and then have the other pieces as stretch goals. 




Lastly, this project is meant to be a solo project, demonstrating what you learned. While you should free
to talk about concepts and share *ideas* - the actual implementation of the project is your implementation.
